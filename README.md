Cyder is an open source project that I started back in 2017 when I completed AP computer science in high school. I began using the IDE's (Eclipse at this point) command line to interact but eventually moved away to a Swing UI system. Now I have moved to IntelliJ IDEA with minimal swing dependencies. The next step in development will be to transition to JavaFX.<br/>
