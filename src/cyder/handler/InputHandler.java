    //todo rick and morty references

    //todo redo pref check section to allow for more prefs added easily
    //todo toggle chat filter on and off

    //todo change vanila color, kind of ugly ngl, not as vanilla, a nicer white perhaps

    //TODO make testing easier with a testing widget, when in debug mode, this automatically opens up

    //todo move fill and outline color in prefs to "Foreground & Font", change to "Colors & Fonts"

    //TODO all icons for ConsoleFrame should be drawn on the spot and not use a png in files

    //todo start log got reset somehow, probably from error being thrown while re-writing
    // change to adding new lines to bottom instead
    //todo hide location if not relased (in debug mode)

    //todo logout should end all executors and threads so only thing happening is login frame

    //todo at end of if statements before saying unrecognized input, try parsing it as a mathematical expression
