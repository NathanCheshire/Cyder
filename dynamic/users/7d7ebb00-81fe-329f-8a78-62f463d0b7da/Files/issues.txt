Issue #223
ModernTextField
Replace the old looking cyder text fields with the new versions seen in the audio player and notes widget with a single bottom bar. Perhaps a ripple animation from the center out when focus is gained or it getting slightly bigger would be nice too.
----------------------------------------
Issue #222
Consolidate single line javadoc comments
Javadoc comments with one line of text should be translated from:

```java
/**
* Comment here.
*/
```
to
```java
/** Comment here. */
```
in order to preserve space yet maintain readability. This will only decrease comment lines in the stats generator.

TeamCity
Look into setting up a testing package structure and write unit tests for a `TemperatureUtil` first (Extract methods for conversion from the temperature widget). Then auto-run these unit tests with JUnit from team city.
----------------------------------------
Issue #217
Fire animation
Make the fire animation like from lume's front page https://lume.land/.

We can do this using circles that move up at a slightly increasing rate, the color changes from red to orange and to yellow, the radius decreases, and possibly the opacity decreases. Play with number of circles generated per second. New circles should appear on top.
----------------------------------------
Issue #216
CyderPasswordField extends CyderTextField
To allow the password field to have access to the methods from the text field class, we need to refactor the password field to extend the text field.
----------------------------------------
Issue #213
Printed Labels Updating
We should keep track of all labels added to the output pane currently and update their font, font size, and foreground as it changes via or updates. This is kind of done for YouTube download progress labels and we update the font size but not the foreground or font if it were to change.

----------------------------------------
Issue #204
Widget/Frame parser
Oh boy.... this is getting into pretty much re-inventing Java FX and view bindings. We should have a parser to allow construction of a frame/widget from a file which will be parsed. We can bind stuff and name stuff from the file to actual UI elements designed in a class. We'll need some rails diagrams for parsing the file and some annotations for bindings such as: `@UiElement` the names must match, `@UiElement(String name)` names do not have to match, `@BuildFrom("path/to/file/TicTacToe.cf")`.
----------------------------------------
Issue #202
Finish paint widget
Finish up features of the paint widget and redo the controls so that they're smaller, perhaps in the top drag label.
The color pallet could be it's own window.
----------------------------------------
Issue #199
Remove some debug log calls
First of all remove the `Logger.Debug` method. Whenever we're logging something as DEBUG see if we should actually have a tag for it and if so, create and replace debug tags with the new one.
----------------------------------------
Issue #196
Investigate badge generator
The text doesn't quite look centered. Test for more badges and different fonts. Maybe even change the font for the badges but not the stat image.
----------------------------------------
Issue #192
Drag Label Button State
Drag label buttons should be able to be stateful meaning they can stay red to indicate the user is on a said page or something. Use this for user editor.
----------------------------------------
Issue #175
Frame transitions between monitors
Moving a frame between monitors results in a super weird bug. This used to work in past versions so maybe figure out where it started and what changed.
----------------------------------------
Issue #171
Busy animation
In addition to the busy icon being toggle-able by the user, we should have a progress indicator such as a dot animation next to the help button (perhaps replace the help button entirely) when cyder is classified as busy.

Make backend secure
Use https for the backend protocol.
----------------------------------------
Issue #148
Make backend port configuable
Allow the fastAPI backend port to be configured at runtime via a prop. Before doing this, the backend should be started by the Java backend somehow (necessary subroutine (make these their own method in Cyder.java)), and still work and be able to be accessed via any http://locahost/PORT. 
----------------------------------------
Issue #147
Rename current background
Implement functionality to allow a user to rename the background they are currently using.
----------------------------------------
Issue #132
Don't resize backgrounds upon console entry
Currently on lower dpi/resolution monitors, rescaling of the background image might be invoked but it might still result in an image too big for the monitor. This should NEVER happen. If we say we're resizing it, it better fit on screen.
