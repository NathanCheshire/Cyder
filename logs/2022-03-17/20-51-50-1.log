[20-57-47] [CONSOLE_OUT]: [STRING] Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. Hydrogen is
           the lightest element. At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2. It is
           colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in
           the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in
           the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. For the
           most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\nIn the early
           universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang. The
           emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination
           epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons.Hydrogen is nonmetallic, except at
           extremely high pressures, and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds
           such as water and nearly all organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid\u2013base reactions 
           because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen
           can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e.,
           cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous
           solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. Because
           hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its
           energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\nHydrogen gas was first
           artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. In 1766\u20131781, Henry Cavendish
           was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, the
           property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means \"water-former\".\nIndustrial production is mainly from
           steam reforming of natural gas, oil reforming, or coal gasification. A small percentage is also produced using more
           energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the
           two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer
           market. Hydrogen is problematic in metallurgy because it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines 
           and storage tanks.
